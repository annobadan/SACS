# Introduction

## Equity and Adequacy in School Finance

- States have continued to implement aggressive resource-based policies over the past decades, aimed in part at reducing achievement gaps (Lafortune, Rothstein, & Schanzenbach, 2018). 

![Average per-pupil revenues for highest and lowest income districts, 1990-2012 (Lafortune, Rothstein, & Schanzenbach, 2018)](~/SACS/documentation/figures/figure01_per-pupil revenue gap.pdf){width=320px} 


## Income Gap in Student Achievement

- Yet the achievement gap between the rich and poor students has grown since the early 1970s despite the concurrent improvement in resource equity and adequacy in school finance (Reardon, 2011).

![Trend in income gap in reading (Reardon, 2011)](~/SACS/documentation/figures/figure02_Trend in income gap in reading.jpg){width=320px} 


## Why? One Plausible Explanation

- Changes in school resource levels have not been able to alter the existing differentiation in **school quality** between the rich and the poor induced by increasing income segregation.


- ex) **Teacher sorting**: Poor students tend to attend schools whose teachers are less experienced or qualified, earn lower salaries, and have lower value-added scores than their rich counterparts (Goldhaber, Lavery, & Theobald, 2015). 


## Focus on *Mediators*

![Causal logic for how student achievement effects from finance reform may be mediated by change in school quality](~/SACS/documentation/figures/figure03_causal diagram.pdf){width=400px} 

- Uncovering not simply *whether* money matters, but *how* money alter teacher qualities or school orgarnizational features


## Research Question

- Do large increases in per-pupil spending in districts serving disadvantaged students lead to changes in distribution of educational *inputs* (teacher characteristics, school organizational features, and curricular structure) across schools in ways that equalize opportunities to learn?

# Analytic and Estimation Strategy

## The Key Empirical Challenge

- School spending is an *endogenous* treatment. 

![A causal diagram](~/SACS/documentation/figures/figure03_causal diagram.pdf){width=400px} 


## Sources of Exogeneity

1. **The timing of reform events** $\rightarrow$ an event study framework
    + assume that the exact timing of school finance reform is as good as random

2. **The funding formula** $\rightarrow$ instrumental variable (IV) estimation
    + leverage only reform-induced variation in funding brought about by the funding formula
    
- California's recent school finance reform, the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) signed into law in 2013, allows us to leverage both sources by conducting *an event study with a simulated IV approach*.


## Research Design

- **Step 1**: Prediction of the counterfactural trends of district per-pupil revenue if LCFF had not occured

- **Step 2**: Estimating LCFF-induced exogenous increases in district per-pupil expenditure

- **Step 3**: Estimating the effect of LCFF-induced increases in funding on the within-district distribution of teacher and school-organization outcomes


## Step 1. Counterfactual Predictions

![Counterfactual Predictions](~/SACS/documentation/figures/figure05_counterfactual predictions.pdf){width=430px} 



## Step 1. Counterfactual Predictions

$$
PPR_{dt} = \sum_{r = 1}^{N_{d}}{I_{r=d}\times (\alpha_{0, r} + \alpha_{1, r} \cdot State_{t} + \alpha_{2, r} \cdot Local_{t})} + \lambda_{t} + \epsilon_{dt}.
$$

- We directly model the predicted district per-pupil revenues as a function of 
    1. California's economic cycle
    2. general underlying differences across districts
    3. district-specific sensitivity of revenues to fluctuations in the statewide business cycle
    


## Step 1. Counterfactual Predictions

$$
PPR_{dt} = \sum_{r = 1}^{N_{d}}{I_{r=d}\times (\alpha_{0, r} + \alpha_{1, r} \cdot State_{t} + \alpha_{2, r} \cdot Local_{t})} + \lambda_{t} + \epsilon_{dt}.
$$

- $PPR_{dt}$: the district per-pupil revenue from the state for district $d$ for year $t$

- $State_{t}$: expenditures for total *state operations*, excluding education-related categories such as spending on state universities and colleges

- $Local_{t}$: the total *local assistance* expenditures outside of spending on K-12 schools, community colleges, and the state teacher retirement system

- $\lambda_{t}$: a year fixed effect

- $\alpha_{1,r}$ and $\alpha_{2, r}$ encapsulate the district-specific sensitivity of revenues to changes in statewide expenditures


## Step 2. LCFF-induced Exogenous Increases in $PPE_{dt}$

$$
PPE_{dt} = \sum_{z=1}^{10}{\sum_{p=0}^{4}{(I_{\mathrm{Exposure_{d}}=p} \times I_{\mathrm{Dosage_{d}}=z}) \cdot \alpha_{p, z}}} + 
$$
$$
\gamma_{1} \cdot \widehat{PPR}_{dt} + \mu_{d} + \lambda_{t} + v_{dt}
$$

- The endogenous treatment $PPE_{dt}$:
    + the district per-pupil spending for district $d$ for year $t$
    + we excludes district spending categories that are distant from classroom instruction, teacher salaries or student support services, such as debt services, capital outlay and facilities


## Step 2. LCFF-induced Exogenous Increases in $PPE_{dt}$

$$
PPE_{dt} = \sum_{z=1}^{10}{\sum_{p=0}^{4}{(I_{\mathrm{Exposure_{d}}=p} \times I_{\mathrm{Dosage_{d}}=z}) \cdot \alpha_{p, z}}} + 
$$
$$
\gamma_{1} \cdot \widehat{PPR}_{dt} + \mu_{d} + \lambda_{t} + v_{dt}
$$

- Control variables
    + time-varying confounder $\widehat{PPR}_{dt}$: the predicted counterfactual per-pupil revenue for district $d$ for year $t$ estimated from step 1. This reflect the dynamic effect of time-varying structural economic conditions on district revenues that might confound the relationship between the LCFF policy treatment and changes in teacher profiles and school-level organizational features
    + $\mu_{d}$ and $\lambda_{t}$ are district and year fixed effects respectively
    



## Step 2. LCFF-induced Exogenous Increases in $PPE_{dt}$

$$
PPE_{dt} = \sum_{z=1}^{10}{\sum_{p=0}^{4}{(I_{\mathrm{Exposure_{d}}=p} \times I_{\mathrm{Dosage_{d}}=z}) \cdot \alpha_{p, z}}} + 
$$
$$
\gamma_{1} \cdot \widehat{PPR}_{dt} + \mu_{d} + \lambda_{t} + v_{dt}
$$


- Instruments:
    + $\mathrm{Exposure_{d}}$: the number of school years after the initial year of LCFF reform for district $d$. This varies from 0 (pre-LCFF years from 2003, before 2013-14) to 4 (post-LCFF year 2016-17)
    + $\mathrm{Dosage_{d}}$: the LCFF-intended amount of supplemental and concentration grants in 2013. This *simulated IV* is generated from the state funding formula $Dosage_{d} = \{ 0.20 \times Base_{d}^{2013} \times UPP_{d}^{2013} \} + \{ 0.50 \times Base_{d}^{2013} \times \mathrm{max}[UPP_{d}^{2013} - 0.55, 0] \}$.


## Step 2. LCFF-induced Exogenous Increases in $PPE_{dt}$

$$
PPE_{dt} = \sum_{z=1}^{10}{\sum_{p=0}^{4}{(I_{\mathrm{Exposure_{d}}=p} \times I_{\mathrm{Dosage_{d}}=z}) \cdot \alpha_{p, z}}} + 
$$
$$
\gamma_{1} \cdot \widehat{PPR}_{dt} + \mu_{d} + \lambda_{t} + v_{dt}
$$

- Thus, $\alpha_{p,z}$ summarize the LCFF-reform induced exogenous increases in per-pupil spending in districts with dosage decile $z$ after $p$ years from the reform.

- $\widehat{PPE}_{dt}$ is the per-pupil student spending for district $d$ for year $t$ instrumented by the two sources of exogeneity. 


## Step 3. The Grouped IV Quantile Regression 

- In finance reform studies, district-level increases in per-pupil spending may have little effect on the district-level *averages* of school quality measures. 

- But they may still move the lower or higher *quantiles* of school quality distributions within a district. 

![The distributional effect of district-level funding increases](~/SACS/documentation/figures/figure06_grouped_IV_quantile.pdf){width=400px} 


## Step 3. The Grouped IV Quantile Regression

- The grouped/multilevel instrumental variable (IV) quantile regresion (Chetverikov, Larsen, & Parmer, 2016) allows us to estimate the *$\color{blue}{\text{distributional}}$* or *$\color{blue}{\text{heterogenous}}$* effects of LCFF-induced funding increases on quantiles of the *within-district distribution* of school-level outcomes.

![The distributional effect of district-level funding increases](~/SACS/documentation/figures/figure06_grouped_IV_quantile.pdf){width=400px} 



## Step 3. The Grouped IV Quantile Regression

Level-1 within-cluster model:

$$
Q_{Y_{sdt}}(\tau) = \alpha_{dt}(\tau) + \beta_{1} \cdot Enroll_{sdt} + \beta_{2} \cdot FRPM_{sdt}, \tau \in (0, 1)
$$

Level-2 between-cluster model:

$$
\alpha_{dt}(\tau) = \sum_{r = -9}^{4}{(I_{r=t} \times \mathrm{log} \widehat{PPE}_{dt}) \cdot \delta_{r}(\tau) + \gamma_{2}(\tau) \cdot \mathrm{log} \widehat{PPR}_{dt} + u_{dt}(\tau)}
$$

- The cluster is difined as a district-by-year cell. 


## Step 3. The Grouped IV Quantile Regression

Level-1 within-cluster model:

$$
Q_{Y_{sdt}}(\tau) = \alpha_{dt}(\tau) + \beta_{1} \cdot Enroll_{sdt} + \beta_{2} \cdot FRPM_{sdt}, \tau \in (0, 1)
$$

- The varying intercept $\alpha_{dt}(\tau)$: the district-by-year-specific conditional quantile of the school level outcome $Y_{sdt}$, after adusting for differences between clusters in the level of the two school-level confounders:
    + total enrollment ($Enroll_{sdt}$)
    + percentage of students eligible for free or reduced priced lunch ($FRPM_{sdt}$)
    
- Each cluster has one value of $\alpha_{dt}(\tau)$.


## Step 3. The Grouped IV Quatile Regression

Level-2 between-cluster model:

$$
\alpha_{dt}(\tau) = \sum_{r = -9}^{4}{(I_{r=t} \times \mathrm{log} \widehat{PPE}_{dt}) \cdot \delta_{r}(\tau) + \gamma_{2}(\tau) \cdot \mathrm{log} \widehat{PPR}_{dt} + u_{dt}(\tau)}
$$

- We are primarily interested in estimating the *difference-in-difference* parameters $\delta_{r}(\tau)$. 

- $\delta_{r}(\tau)$ represnets the difference in the effect of $\mathrm{log} \widehat{PPE}_{dt}$ on $\alpha_{dt}(\tau)$ between reference year 2012-13 ($t = 0$, the year prior to June 2013 enactment of LCFF) and $t$ years after (or before) the reference year after controlling for the effect of the time-varying confounder $\mathrm{log} \widehat{PPR}_{dt}$.   



# Findings

## Teacher Characteristics

- LCFF-induced increases in funding result in significant increases in the perentages of teachers who were newly hired to their districts, including novice teachers. 

- The newly hired teachers appear most often to be non-tenured (long-term substitutes, probationary).

- High-poverty schools hired more white teachers and teachers holding a master's degree or more.


## Districts and schools hired rising counts of new teachers

![](~/SACS/figures/20_AERJ Publication/Figure_01_Teacher Staffing_01_Between School/Cropped_Plot_01_New in district and Mean yrs in district.pdf){width=400px} 

- 10% increases in LCFF-induced funding $\rightarrow$ a 0.95 percentage point gain in the share of newly hired teachers in the first LCFF year

## Organizational Features & Curricular Structure

- LCFF-induced funding increases lowered average class size. 

- Schools in district receiveing larger funding increases shrink the count of college-prep courses in proportion to growing number of elective courses.

- We found no evidence that LCFF-induced funding successfully reduced disparities in access to experienced teachers or A-G courses by EL students.


## LCFF-induced funding increases lowered average class size

![](~/SACS/figures/20_AERJ Publication/Figure_03_Curricula Structure/Cropped_Plot_07_Class size_Elementary School.pdf){width=200px}

- Elementary schools show immediate declines in class size after on year of LCFF exposure.

- Though statistically significant, effect sizes were modest: 10% increase in funding $\rightarrow$ reduce class size by 0.59


## LCFF-induced funding increases lowered average class size

![](~/SACS/figures/20_AERJ Publication/Figure_03_Curricula Structure/Cropped_Plot_08_Class size_High School.pdf){width=400px}

- High schools felt the effect incrementally as the exposure to the reform accumulates.



## The proportional shrinkage of college-prep courses

![](~/SACS/figures/20_AERJ Publication/Figure_03_Curricula Structure/Cropped_Plot_09_A-G Classes.pdf){width=400px}

- 10% increase in LCFF-induced funding $\rightarrow$ lower the % ELA classes always approved as A-G about 0.52 percentage point in the third year of reform

- This occurs most severely at the higher quantile ($\tau = 0.8$), in schools that began with higher shares of college-prep courses in the reference year



# Discussion and Policy Implications

## School Quality vs. School Quantity

- Klopfer (2017) found that finance infusions did not lead districts or schools to hire more teachers or better qualified instructional staff. 

- But fresh funding did affect the length of the academic year, on average, allowing districts or schools to add additional instructional days. 

- Our findings from the recent California case show that new funding did go for addtional teaching positions. 


## Between-school Teacher Sorting

- The schools with lower shares of white or master's holder tend to serve higher-poverty stduents (84.5% white teachers in lowest-poverty schools, 47.6% in highest-poverty schools)
    
- The grouped IV quantile regression allowed us to find that the infusion of new LCFF dollars helped high-poverty schools to attract more white or better highly-educated teachers, mitigating any disproportionate sorting of teachers between schools.


## Within-school Teacher Sorting

- We observe the significant disparities in access to experienced teachers or A-G courses by EL students, which has widened particularly in high-poverty schools during the post-LCFF period.

- We found no evidence that LCFF-induced funding successfully reduced the disparities. 

- This raise concern that *within-school* teacher sorting may prevent experienced teachers from being assigned to students who need them most, even when *between-school* teacher sorting can be mitigated by school finance reform.  


## The Curricular Structure

- The curricular structure of high schools began to de-emphasize college-prep courses after 2013 enactment of LCFF. 

- This may have occurred in response to the partial collapse of NCLB and strict testing-and-accountability policies. 

- Or, the hiring of new teachers may have allowed schools the chance to recover lost elective courses during the recession.
